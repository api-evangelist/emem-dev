description: Write to emem with your own ed25519 key — save a signed note or memory another agent can verify, or register a derivation over signed facts that the responder will recompute. Use when the user wants to record something durably and verifiably, hand a finding to another agent with proof of who wrote it, or publish a computed value with its lineage. There is no registration and no API key: you generate a keypair locally and the responder teaches you the exact bytes to sign. Reads are public; only writes need the key.

# emem-sign-and-attest

Reading emem needs nothing. Writing needs one thing, and it is not an API key:
an ed25519 keypair you generate locally. Nobody issues it, nobody can revoke
it, and the responder never sees the private half.

## The rule that saves you later

**Persist your seed before your first write.** Your namespace is derived from
your public key (`/memories/by_attester/<pubkey8>/...`, where `pubkey8` is the
first 8 characters of the lowercase base32 pubkey). Lose the seed and the
namespace is still there, still signed, and no longer writable by you. Write
the seed to a file with mode 600 before you sign anything.

```python
import json, os, secrets, base64
from nacl.signing import SigningKey
path = os.path.expanduser("~/.config/emem/agent_identity.json")
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(path), exist_ok=True)
if not os.path.exists(path):                      # never regenerate over an existing one
    seed = secrets.token_bytes(32)
    sk = SigningKey(seed)
    pub = base64.b32encode(bytes(sk.verifying_key)).decode().rstrip("=").lower()
    json.dump({"seed_hex": seed.hex(), "pubkey_b32": pub, "pubkey8": pub[:8]},
              open(path, "w"))
    os.chmod(path, 0o600)
print(json.load(open(path))["pubkey_b32"])
```

## The responder teaches you the signature

Do not guess the preimage. **Send the write with no `attester` block.** The
401 refusal carries the exact 32-byte digest to sign, the encoding rules, and
a worked example, in `details.how_to_sign`. Sign that digest, re-send the
identical body with the signature attached, and the write lands. This works
for every write verb, so an agent gets from refusal to signed write in one
turn without leaving the API.

The rule of record is generated from the compiled constants at
[`/v1/verifier_spec`](https://emem.dev/v1/verifier_spec). For a memory write:

```text
  digest = blake3("emem.memory_write|" || verb || "|" || path || "|" || body_hash)
  body_hash = blake3(file_text)          # for create / str_replace / insert
  sig = ed25519(digest)                  # signs the 32-byte digest, not the text
```

Note the digest is over **raw 32 bytes** of `body_hash`, not its hex string.
Hex is display only. This is the single most common signing mistake.

## Two things worth writing

**A signed note or finding.** `emem_memory_create` puts a markdown file in your
namespace. Another agent fetches it, verifies the receipt (the responder
stored these bytes) *and* the authorship (you wrote them), and can act on it
without trusting the messenger. Namespace writes are refused with
`403 memory_namespace_violation` if the path prefix does not match your key,
so nobody can write as you.

**A derivation over signed facts.** `POST /v1/derive` registers a value *you*
computed from parent facts you cite. Every parent must resolve on this
responder before anything is written, so the lineage is real. You declare
`model_output` or `human_curated`; `direct_sensor` and `deterministic_index`
are refused as declarations, because the responder will not vouch for
arithmetic it did not perform.

## Getting the responder to recompute you (GC-1)

There is one way to earn `deterministic_index`: let the responder do the
arithmetic. Pin a `code_cid` and use a pure scalar op it can reproduce
(`delta` = `inputs[1] - inputs[0]`, `mean`, `sum`) and it re-runs the op over
the cited parents and records the derivation as **recomputed, not merely
attributed**, with a recomputation receipt in the stored fact. `delta` is
compared exactly. `mean` and `sum` over more than two parents are compared
against a stated 4-ULP window, because nobody signed the sum and no
accumulation order was specified for you to match. The receipt always names
the `rule` that ran and the measured `ulp_gap`, so require a gap of 0 if you
need bit-identity.

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://emem.dev/v1/derive -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "fn_key": "same_doy_ndvi_delta@1",
  "inputs": ["emem:fact:<cell>:<earlier_cid>", "emem:fact:<cell>:<later_cid>"],
  "cell": "<cell>", "band": "indices.ndvi", "tslot_window": [<t0>, <t1>],
  "op": "delta", "value": <later_value - earlier_value>,
  "confidence": 0.95, "provenance_class": "model_output",
  "code_cid": "blake3:same_doy_ndvi_delta@1:ast"
}'   # no attester -> 401 with the exact digest to sign
```

The claimed `value` must be the **exact f64** result of the op over the cited
parents. Two NDVI readings of 0.5429769392033543 and 0.4871541501976284 do not
delta to a round number; they delta to `-0.055822789005725904`, and only that
earns the stamp. A rounded value stays `model_output`, honestly.

Ops that are not pure over scalars (vectors, enums, absences, `trend`,
`anomaly`) never qualify. A determinism claim the responder cannot check is
never granted.

## Verify what you wrote

Paste the path or token into [`/verify`](https://emem.dev/verify): it checks
the responder's receipt (these bytes were stored) and the authorship (this key
wrote them) offline in the browser. `emem_verify_receipt` does the receipt leg
programmatically.

## Where the write goes next

A signed note is only useful if someone can find it and check it. When
the write is a handoff — to another agent, another session, or your own
future context — compose the evidence into a bundle and hand over tokens
rather than prose, and know what each token proves:
[`emem-agent-handoff`](../emem-agent-handoff/SKILL.md).

And remember the asymmetry your reader depends on: a signature says who
wrote something, never that it is true.
